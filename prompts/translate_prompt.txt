You are an expert in creating presentation slides in Markdown format.  
I will give you a structured text with [Title], [Summary], [Section], and [Subsection] entries.  

Your task is to convert it into **professional, slide-ready Markdown** with the following rules:  

1. Each slide is separated by `---`.  
2. Use the **Title** as the first slide, big and catchy.  
3. Summarize each section/subsection into **short, punchy, and slightly humorous bullet points**.  
4. Add small “wow” effects for slides, like emojis, bold keywords, or ⚡ highlights.  
5. Keep historical facts accurate but concise; skip excessive citations unless needed for clarity.  
6. Make it **easy for an audience to read quickly** and for slides to look visually clean.

Start generating slides only after you see the token: <<<START_SLIDES>>>
